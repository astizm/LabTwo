This week we've been building our knowledge of variables, expressions and operators as well as forcing the habit of taking notes while learning code. Today we were also peer-coding again but more geared towards a discussion basis, where we can discuss our ideas and figure out what's going on together, as opposed to having one person coding and the other leading the way. More shortcuts learned this week as well! (The shortcuts for opening and closing Quokka were my most used).

The more time I spend working on Visual Studio and the more I learn the better I feel about my abilities in class. I feel I'm starting to understand the processes we're using and where I can adjust when things don't work out. Sometimes it's just a matter of getting my brain in the right head space, but it's also important that I keep working on these skills outside of class. As with everything, practise makes perfect, or at least functioning!
